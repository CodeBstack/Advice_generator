# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app

A Simple application I implemented with vanilla javascript.

I made use of async/await to get the advice from the specified API.

Then I used the MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture to have a readable and understandable codebase.

I also used the publisher subscriber pattern for the event listener.
